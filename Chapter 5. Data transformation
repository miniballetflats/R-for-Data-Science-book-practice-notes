# ... with 336,766 more rows, and 10 more variables: carrier <chr>, flight <int>,
#   tailnum <chr>, origin <chr>, dest <chr>, air_time <dbl>, distance <dbl>, hour <dbl>,
#   minute <dbl>, time_hour <dttm>

This data frame contains all 336,776 flights that 
departed from New York City in 2013. 
The data comes from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 
and is documented in ?flights.

#int stands for integers.
#dbl stands for doubles, or real numbers.
#chr stands for character vectors, or strings.
#dttm stands for date-times (a date + a time).

#lgl stands for logical, vectors that contain only TRUE or FALSE.
#fctr stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical 
variables with fixed possible values.
#date stands for dates.

#Pick observations by their values (filter()).
#Reorder the rows (arrange()).
#Pick variables by their names (select()).
#Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()). & transmute()
#Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise())

used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function 
from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group

5.2 Filter rows with filter()

filter(flights, month==1, day==1)
jan1<- filter(flights, month==1, day==1)

jan1

dec25<-filter(flights, month==12,day==25)

dec25

5.2.1 Comparisons

#R provides the standard suite: >, >=, <, <=, != (not equal), and == (equal).

5.2.2 Logical operators

Multiple arguments to filter() are combined with “and”: 
every expression must be true in order for a row to be included in the output.
Boolean operators yourself: & is “and”, | is “or”, and ! is “not”.

The following code finds all flights that departed in November or December
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)

alternative, hort-hand for this problem is x %in% y

nov_dec<-filter(flights, month %in% c(11,12))

nov_dec

alternative : filter(flights, !(month %in% c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)))

filter(flights, !(arr_delay>120|dep_delay>120))

filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)

5.2.3 Missing values

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use is.na():

is.na(x)
#> [1] TRUE

df <- tibble(x=c(1,NA, 3,5))

df
# A tibble: 4 x 1
      x
  <dbl>
1     1
2    NA
3     3
4     5

filter(df, x>1)
# A tibble: 2 x 1
      x
  <dbl>
1     3
2     5

filter(df, is.na(x)|x>1)
# A tibble: 3 x 1
x
<dbl>
    1    NA
2     3
3     5

5.2.4 Exercise
#Find all flights that

#Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
filter(flights, arr_delay>=120)

#Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236
filter(flights, dest=="IAH"|dest=="HOU")
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))

#Were operated by United, American, or Delta
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236
UA	United Air Lines Inc.
AA	American Airlines Inc.
DL	Delta Air Lines Inc.
filter(flights, carrier=="AA"|carrier=="UA"|carrier=="DL")
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))

Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
filter(flights, month==7|month==8|month==9)
filter(flights, month %in% c(7,8,9))
filter(flights, month %in% 7:9)
filter(flights, !(month %in% c(1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12)))

Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late
filter(flights, arr_delay>120 & dep_delay<=0)

Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
# For example, if dep_delay is 10 minutes late then arr_delay should be
# 10 mins lates. 10 - 10 = 0, so air time was on time.
# If dep_delay is 10 minutes late but arr_delay  is -20 minutes earlier, then
# arr_delay SHOULD'VE been 10 but instead is -20 (because of 30 catch up), so
# 10 - (-20) = 30.
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, (dep_delay - arr_delay > 30))

Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
filter(flights, dep_time >= 2400 | dep_time <= 600)

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). 
What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to 
answer the previous challenges?
filter(flights, between(dep_time, 601, 2359))

How many flights have a missing dep_time? 
What other variables are missing? 
What might these rows represent?
sum(is.na(flights$dep_time))

Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? 
  Why is FALSE & NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? 
  (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)

Because anything that is `^ 0` equals `1`.
Because NA | TRUE is saying whether one of the 
two is `TRUE` and the second one is.
Because at least one of the two expressions can be tested: 
  FALSE & NA. In NA & NA neither can be tested and the results is `NA & NA`.

The general rule is that whenever there is a logical expressions, 
if one can be tested, then the result shouldn't be `NA`. 
And any operation that the results is determined, 
regardless of the number, 
the inputting `NA` does not affect the result.
